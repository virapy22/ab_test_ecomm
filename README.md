Developed by virapy22

This project was created as a part of the Udacity Data Science nanodegree program. The project objective was to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 

The dataset containing the conversion rates between new and old websites for an e-commerce website is going to be analyzed. The data will be used to perform an A/B test with the eventual objective of working through the notebook to help the understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.
